Points of Difficulty:

1. Video
The video was probably the most difficult task. The video didn't position well and when I put the video on the website, the height and width wouldn't match the wireframe at all. I tried a lot of things, but I can't the same position as the wireframe.

2. Positioning
The wireframe was moderately specific of the positioning, so I tried my best to position it as accurately as possible.

3. Font
The wireframe didn't have the specific font they used. I used Helvetica throughout the whole document. I tried searching up the font on WhatTheFont.com, but one must pay to use these fonts.

Additional features:
1. Animations
Click and hover animations on some parts of the page are existant.

2. ARIA and alt
Images have alt and ARIA for hard of sight users.
